# Artificial-Intelligence-Exploration
Implementation and exploration of four classic Artificial Intelligence problems.

### Gomoku

Gomoku is an abstract strategy board game which is traditionally played with Go pieces (black and white stones) on a Go board, using 15 × 15 of the 19 × 19 grid intersections. I implemented an well-performed AI agent which is able to make effective decisions on the next step during the online game.

### CARP

The capacitated arc routing problem (CARP) is an NP-hard problem in vehicle routing with applications where a service must be provided by a set of vehicles on specified roads.

### IMP

Influence Maximization (IMP) is the problem of  finding a small subset of nodes in a social network that could maximize the spread of influence. 

- Check here for my [Technical Report of IMP](https://rainytong.github.io/files/technical_report_imp.pdf).



### SVM

Support Vector Machine(SVM, also support vector network) is used to classify data by  finding the best hyperplane that separates all data points of one class from those of the other class. The best hyperplane
for an SVM means the one with the largest margin between the two classes. Margin means the maximal
width of the slab parallel to the hyperplane that has no interior data points.
